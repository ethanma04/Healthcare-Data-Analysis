# Healthcare Data Analysis Using SQL Queries and Tableau for Data Visualization

This data analysis project utilizes **SQL** queries to explore various situations and cases that occur in the healthcare industry such as emergency room visits, patient demographics, and cost of procedures.
The project also utilizes **Tableau** as a source for data visualization and a limited amount of **Excel** for data cleaning.

The data is generated from Synthea and has no association to any healthcare record platform. Furthermore, this data is not reflective of any real patient's past or current clinical data. This means that the data is fake and is being used for educational purposes only.

There were three categories of sample questions that were focused on in this project that being:
- Encounter Data Analysis
- Patient Demographic
- Cost and Payment Analysis


Encounter Data Analysis Sample Questions:
- What is the average base encounter cost for ambulatory encounters?
- How many encounters were classified as hospital encounters with a problem in 2022?
- What are the most common reasons for encounters in the dataset?

Patient Demographic Sample Questions:
- What is our patient mix by race and ethnicity?
- What is the age groups?
- How many unique patients are there?

Cost and Payment Analysis Sample Questions:
- How does the average total encounter cost vary between different payers?
- What is the distribution of payers within the dataset?
- Which payer accounts for the highest total encounter costs?

The queried data is then created into graphs and chart dashboards for better visualization using Tableau.
